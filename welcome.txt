Hello! My name is Patrice Kenmo√©, I live in Dublin(IE) and I look like this. 

My current goal is to be a tech entrepreneur 

Since recentlyt I try to talk to computers, and I also have a blog where I try to write interesting things about the books I read and the life I live 

This is my coding sandbox in which you could inspect my baby footsteps if you really get bored
